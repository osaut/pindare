## 1. What is Pindare?
Pindare is a gem for evaluating and calibrating simple mathematical models based on Ordinary Differential Equations. Its main purpose is to speed-up the development of new ODE models for tumor growth that could be used with clinical data.

It is also my first ruby gem, so for me it is a way for becoming a better rubyist.
